Day-1 (01 July, 2016)

l1ghtsab3r team go!

Day 1 marked our official kickoff and we were so excited. We had discussed what problems we would be tackling and what we would be starting with. A conference call with all members a day before had us all pumped up. Seeing the other teams so enthuthiastic we got even more excited about starting work.

We had already set up our environments during the application process. However, we were missing out on the test suite. Both of us were being faced with the same problem.
I'll go into a little technical detail here. The error 'module' object has no attribute 'test_codecs'. We searched a lot but couldn't find a solution. We pinged our mentor Sambhav, who came to the rescue. He told us that test_codecs was a standard file that is usually installed along with some standard libraries. However, our version of python seemed to be missing it. This error only seemed to arise while using virtualenv

He suggested we proceed in the following steps:
1. cd ~/<anywhere>
2. mkdir pysource
3. wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/Python-3.4.2.tgz
4. tar -zxvf Python-3.4.2.tgz
5. cd Python-3.4.2.tgz
6. mkdir .install
7. ./configure --prefix=$PWD/.install
8. make
9. make install
10. cd ~/your_dev_space
11. virtualenv -p ~/<anywhere>/pysource/Python-3.4.2/.install/bin/python3.4 env
12. . env/bin/activate
13. Do pip install -e . and ant java
14. python setup.py test

We would be adding these steps to the VOC documentation for others to take benefit of.

Our first day was spent in resolving this problem and though we couldn't start coding, we were excited to get started.
