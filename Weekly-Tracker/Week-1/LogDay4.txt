Day-4 (04 July, 2016)

### Completed the following tasks:

* Added test cases for round
* Improved modulo method for Float
* Added Unary Operators for Bool including pos, neg, invert.

Added test cases for float to test round half to even feature. This resulted
in breaking the modulo function. Fixed the Float part of the modulo function.
The Int part shows precision error due to implementation. However, same code
copied in Int and Float. So, need to modify both.
Implemented the unary operators for Bool.

### New interesting thing learnt today:

* Round can be implemented in many ways. Python uses the round half to even
behaviour. i.e. round(4.5) = 4. round(3.5) = 4
* Modulo is implemented differently for different language. Different language
creators could not decide whether the final answer should have the sign of the
dividend or the divisor, so every language makes it's own specification. Java
uses the sign of the dividend. i.e 4.5 % -4.5 = 0.0. Python uses the sign of the
divisor. i.e. 4. 5 % -4.5 = -0.0

Tomorrow, we'll be tackling the precision error and the methods for List. A lot
of tests for that seem to not have been implemented yet. Would look into that
as well.

Had good interaction with coaches. Learnt a few things. All in all, a good day!
