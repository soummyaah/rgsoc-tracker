Day-3 (03 July, 2016)

Completed the following tasks:

[x] round without ndigits method for float
[] round with ndigits method for float

Completed the without ndigits part of round. Referred to CPython to
see how exactly it works. Took fedback from mentors. For ndigits part,
more research on implementation required. :/

Tomorrow, we'll be tackling the ndigits portion of Float and the
contains method of String. We would also be looking into the List and
Dict datatypes.
